create a new repository on the command line
-------------------------------------------
echo "# Demo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:Yumesh-Kumar/Demo.git
git push -u origin main


push an existing repository from the command line
-------------------------------------------------
git remote add origin git@github.com:Yumesh-Kumar/Demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


To see the git branches
------------------------
git branch -a  "shows all remote branches"
git branch "shows all local branch"
git branch myNewBranch    "Create local branch named 'myNewBranch'"    


#A local branch is a branch that only you (the local user) can see. It exists only on your local machine.
#A remote branch is a branch on a remote location (in most cases origin). You can push the newly created local branch myNewBranch to origin. Now other users can track it. Until you push the local branch to your repository, that branch is not shown in GitHub repository.

In some cases, you may want to push your changes to another branch on the remote repository 

Pushing the code to another without pushing in current branch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin <currentBranch>:<remoteBranch>  

# Do not use space between colon (:) while passing the branch name

Pushing the code to another without pushing in current branch.
--------------------------------------------------------------
# first push the code to current branch

 git add .
 git commit -m "message"
 git push or 
 git push "current branch name" both are considerable

#Then push it into another
git push origin <currentBranch>:<remoteBranch>

Cloning the repositories
------------------------

1 Clone the main branch with fetching all remote branches
git clone --branch <branchName> <remote-repo-url> or
git clone -b <branchName> <remote-repo-url>

2 Clone the main branch with fetching single remote branch
git clone --branch <branchName> --single-branch <remote-repo-url>
git clone -b <branchName> --single-branch <remote-repo-url>
