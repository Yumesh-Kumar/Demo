Before Using git we must want to understand the basics of git and github. let's get starts

What is git ==>
    => git provides as a platform where we manage our source code, by tracking the code changes.
    => It also known as version control system. That you can control version of your software and 
       also can manage your source code.
    => It also helps to developer to work in a single project at a time with collaborating with different 
       functionalities so the development can be archive in fast way.
    => before using git you must be install it in your machine. for this visit the official site of git/github

What is github ==>
    => gitHub provides us a platform where developer can manage,share and collaborate their source code 
       with multiple developers.
    => the git commands helps to the developer to manage their repositories in github .
    => the github gives us repository management system from where we can manage the source code
    => before using github you must be have an account in github. for this visit the official site of git/github

Working of gitHub with git ==>

1 Basically when we initiate to work in a project it is more time taking when a single developer works on it and also
  complex to manage the source code without tracking the changes history of the code.
2 Suppose multiple developers are working in the project with deciding their tasks and the finish them also but now the major 
  task is add the changes in a single source code section so that all changes occur in a place .
3 Besides this situations we got multiple cases where from we can see that it is more hard to manage the project in place of developing.
4 All this problem solved by git and github. Github is repository where we put our source code and the git is a system from which we manage our code.
4 github allows as to make copy of our code in a multiple sub-repositories i.e. branches and we can make changes them and just merge the accepting
  code with our main branch.
5 In gitHUb our working starts as follows ---
  => Firstly we create a repository to our github account and upload the project source code.
  => After upload the project our project code is having in main branch of our repository. We can 
     create multiple branches and assign them to the different developers so that they can work on 
     it in parallel way with different tasks .
  => A clone operation is done with our local machine so that by we can access our project source code
     when the cloning is done we can switch to a particular branch and start working on it .
  => After cloning a repository we are eligible to access the repository. The cloned repository that 
     we have in our machine is known as local repository while the repository of gitHUb is called remote repository
  => When we make changes in our local repository it must be push to our remote repository so that changes is occur 
     in remote repository . the to major operations push and pull are performed by us for both uploading and receiving 
     the changes .

Let as we go with a repository name 'demo' in your gitHub account for practicing and we go with it for our git commands and gitHub practice
